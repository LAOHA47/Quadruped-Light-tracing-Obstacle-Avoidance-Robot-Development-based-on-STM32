# Quadruped-Light-tracing-Obstacle-Avoidance-Robot-Development-based-on-STM32
Designed a hardware model for the robot in SolidWorks and conducted joint simulation in MATLAB to test and optimize mechanicsâ€™ parameters such as the motor speed and servo speed
Employed infrared sensor, light sensor, and infrared distance sensor, obstacle avoidance objective detection, and phototactic movement
Used the Luby-Crater software to build a logic control chart, programmed the robot functions with C language, and encapsulated the functions into a module to ensure stability and convenient maintenance of the robot
